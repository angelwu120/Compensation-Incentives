This program aims to calculate excutives' compensation incentives, captured by delta and vega. Specifically, delta measures the dollar change in  executive's firm based wealth for a 1% change in stock price, in thousands; vega measures the dollar change in the executive's firm based wealth for a 1% change in stock return standard deviation, in thousands.

The culculation is proceeded in R based on Dr. Lalitha Naaven's (https://sites.temple.edu/lnaveen/data/) and Dr. Kai Chen's (https://www.kaichen.work/?p=211) SAS codes. 

Note that datasets can be downloaded from WRDS subscriptions. 

If you use this program, please cite Lalitha Naaven's paper (Coles, Daniel, and Naveen, 2006) and acknowledge Dr. Kai Chen's work. I would appreciate it if you also kindly acknowledge my work.
