The program aims to calculate excutives' compensation incentives, captured by delta and vega. Specifically, delta measures the dollar change in  executive's firm based wealth for a 1% change in stock price, in thousands; vega measures the pound change in the executive's firm based wealth for a 1% change in stock return standard deviation, in thousands.

The culculation is proceeded in R based on Dr. Lalitha Naaven's (https://sites.temple.edu/lnaveen/data/) and Dr. Kai Chen's (https://www.kaichen.work/?p=211) SAS codes. 

Note that "execomp.csv" is too large to upload. The dataset can be downloaded from Compustat Executive Compensation - Annual Compensation.
